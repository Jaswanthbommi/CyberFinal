                <h1>Hello! Thank You for visiting my page.</h1>
                <p>It was pleasure having you visit my page. It was tough in the start, to get started with and to
                    revisit the concepts
                    and application of HTML,CSS and Javascipt after a good gap of 4 years. But through this exercise, I
                    thouroughly
                    enjoyed the process of learning and gaining knowledge of buliding a web page. As a Art-lover, it was
                    truely amazing
                    to design a page about me. Hope you enjoyed your time here.

                </p>

                <p>I created 3 grids, showcasing 3 areas of interest about me in the first page(ABOUT ME). Apart from
                    these 3 things,
                    there are fields that I want to explore in near furture. Some are, Project Management ; Scrum Master
                    roles.
                    On lighter notes, yoga ; photography. These other interests that I talked about, should get included
                    here soon! :)
